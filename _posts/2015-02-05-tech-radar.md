I made my [personal Tech Radar](/tech_radar.html).
It's a bit different from the [Thoughtworks Tech radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). I changed the rings definition and it's less suggestive and more personal. It's mainly to help me see where I stand now and where I want to go with my skills in the near future.

I will make a new radar in 6 months to see how things have changed. It should be interesting, at least I hope :).
