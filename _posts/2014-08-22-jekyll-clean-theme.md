Was looking for some hosting to create my own personal site.

Thanks to [suls.org](http://suls.org) for telling me about Jekyll and github pages.
https://pages.github.com/.

Quite neat.


Made me rememeber when I made an html static page generator with VB 6 for creating a tourism company website. In 2002?
