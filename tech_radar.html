    <h1>Personal tech radar [2016-01]</h1>

	<p>	
	I plan to do this exercice every 6 months to see how much my skills are growing. <br>
	It should also give me a push to learn more and faster. <br>
	Got the idea of a personal tech radar from http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html<br>
</p>

    <p> I changed the definition of the 4 rings: </p>
	<ul class="list-group">
	  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Adopted:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I've worked with recently and became confident with. </li>
	  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Trying:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I've tried a bit and want to gain more knowledge on. </li>
	  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Will try:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I've not used/tried yet & want to take a more serious look in the next 6 months.</li>
	   <li class="list-group-item"><b>Hold:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I would like to try in the future, but don't feel the need to look into in the next 6 months. <br>Also may include technologies I have tried, but don't feel I would need them in my skillset now (or ever).</li>
	</ul>

    <h1>Explanation</h1>

    <p>
    	Let me explain a bit each technologies I put on my radar.
    </p>

	 <table class="table">
	    <thead>
	      <tr>
	        <th>Techniques</th>
	        <th>Radar status</th>
	        <th>Why?</th>
	      </tr>
	    </thead>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr>
	        <td>Deployement pipeline</td>
	        <td>Adopted</td>
	        <td>Worked on a few deployement pipeline on jenkins, last year. It makes the deployement process much easier to follow and less error prone.
	        http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1621865&seqNum=2</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td>Post-mortems</td>
	        <td>Adopted</td>
	        <td>After every issue in my team we do a post-mortem. The goal is to find the issues that we would not pickup when thinking on the surface. To find the root causes we use the 5 whys technique.</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td>'Scrum'</td>
	        <td>Adopted</td>
	        <td>I am not confident to say that I use the 'real' Scrum at work. But we try our best to follow scrum's most important principles.</td>
	      </tr>
 		  <tr>
	        <td>Pair programming</td>
	        <td>Trying</td>
	        <td>I've been hearing the virtues of pair programming for years, but never really gave it a chance at work. So far so good. </td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td>Continuous Delivery</td>
	        <td>Trying</td>
	        <td>Since most softwares are now running on the web, mastering continuous delivery is  a must. And yet CD is overlooked by a lot of people building softwares. It's non-sense to call a team an agile team if it cannot do CD. </td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td>Blue-green deployment</td>
	        <td>Trying</td>
	        <td>To be able to do CD..you need to be able to have nodowntime deployment. The blue-green deployement is a smart technique for that. </td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td>Grows method</td>
	        <td>Will try</td>
	        <td>The grows method is really attractive. When I read a book about 'Scrum' I feel it's a bit too radical: It's all or nothing. But in the reality of work, a team needs time to <b>gradually</b> adopt to a new method of work. The people who are working on the grows method seems to have understood that.
	        I think the grows method would fit well with my current team.</td>
	      </tr>
 	      <tr>
	        <td>XP</td>
	        <td>Hold</td>
	        <td>I really want to take a look at XP. But first I want to check the grows method and become an expert at CD, that's why I will wait a bit before starting studying about it.</td>
	      </tr>
	     	<tr>
	        <td>Canary release</td>
	        <td>Hold</td>
	        <td>I really really want to try this deployement technique. But my current team is not ready for it yet. Will wait until we master CD & can do blue-green deployement.</td>
	      </tr>
	          	<tr>
	        <td>Machine learning</td>
	        <td>Hold</td>
	        <td>The understanding of Machine learning will become basic skillset for software engineers in the future. I don't want to miss the boat too much while i'm aging.. But I first want to take time to learn functional programing first. </td>
	      </tr>
	    </tbody>
	   	<thead>
	      <tr>
	        <th>Tools</th>
	        <th>Radar status</th>
	        <th>Why?</th>
	      </tr>
	    </thead>
	   	<tbody>
