    <h1>Personal tech radar [2016-01]</h1>
	
	Idea from http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html
    <br><br>
    <p> Here is my personal definition of the 4 rings: </p>
	<ul class="list-group">
	  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Adopt:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I've worked with recently and became confident with. </li>
	  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Trial:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I've tried a bit and want to gain more knowledge on. </li>
	  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Asses:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I've not used/tried yet & want to take a more serious look in the next 6 months.</li>
	   <li class="list-group-item"><b>Hold:</b> Technologies & Techniques that I would like to try in the future, but don't feel the need to look into in the next 6 months. <br>Also may include technologies I have tried, but don't feel I would need them in my skillset now (or ever).</li>
	</ul>
